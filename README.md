The four sides of the registration app are the following:

Parent Side
-----------
1. The Parent is registering a student that hasn't previously attended the school they are registering for
2. The Parent is registering a student that has attended the school they are registering for, and the student is active (attended the previous year).
3. The Parent is registering a student that has attended the school they are registering for, but the student is inactive (did not attend the previous year).

The data that the Parent enters will be stored in a temporary, "staging" table. The Admin will then look at that data and determine if it should be imported into PS. See below 

Admin Side
----------
4. All three of the Parent side sides funnel into the Admin Side, which is where a PS Admin (usually a secretary) will examine, verify, validate, and modify (when needed) the data that the Parent entered. Once it is verified here, it will be imported into PS proper. Some of the data will need to be imported using the REST Enroll New Student functionality, other pieces will be customized data imports that tie into student contacts, etc.
