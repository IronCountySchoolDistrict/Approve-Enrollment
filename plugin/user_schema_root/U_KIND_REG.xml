               the id of the FormBuilder form response is inserted here. This field is used to determine if the
               Approve Enrollment link should appear red. This value should match the id of the most recent
               FormBuilder response for this student, meaning that the approved response is the most recent one.
               If there is an id in this field that does not match the most recent response id for the student,
               that response should be approved. If this field blank for the student, the response should also be approved."/>
